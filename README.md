I created this todo app as part of The Odin Project. It was the biggest project I've completed so far, and I ended up spending around 2 months working on it off and on.

It's my first project which I've built from the ground up using webpack, classes, and multiple JavaScript files. It's been a great learning experience, and I'm pleased
to have built something which can actually be useful to me (or someone else hopefully). It's still very basic - you can create projects, which contain lists, which contain singular todo items.
You can create and delete items, change their titles/dates/priority, and that's about it. 

I am passing this off as a working version which can be used on a web browser, but before continuing onto the next module 
I would like to make it usable for mobile also as I haven't done that for any of my previous projects. 
I would also like to clean up a lot of my code in ui-controller.js as I feel like it's gotten a bit unweidlly at this point.
